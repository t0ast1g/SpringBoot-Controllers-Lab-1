Lab 1 - Spring Boot Web Application

Author: Gabby Herlocher
Student ID: M16227250

This project is a minimal Spring Boot web app with two pages: the homepage at / mapped to index.html (shows a hello message with full name) and the about page at /about mapped to about.html (shows full name, student ID, short bio, and contact details). A simple controller routes the URLs to the templates.

Run in IntelliJ IDEA:

Open IntelliJ IDEA → File → New → Project from Existing Sources → select the project folder (pom.xml).
Wait for Maven to import dependencies.
Open Lab1Application.java, click the green Run icon next to the main method (or right‑click → Run).
In your browser: http://localhost:8080/ for Home, http://localhost:8080/about for About.
